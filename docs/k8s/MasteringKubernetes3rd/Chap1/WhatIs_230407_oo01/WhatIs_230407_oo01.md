## What Kubernetes is

Kubernetes is a platform that **encompasses a huge number of services** and capabilities that keeps growing. The core functionality is **scheduling workloads in containers across your infrastructure**, but it doesn't stop there. Here are some of the other capabilities Kubernetes brings to the table:

- Mounting storage systems
- Distributing secrets
- Checking application health and readiness
- Replicating application instances
- Using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- Using Cluster Autoscaling
- Naming and service discovery
- Balancing loads
- Rolling updates
- Monitoring resources
- Accessing and ingesting logs
- Debugging applications
- Providing authentication and authorization


## Cattle versus pets

- In the olden days ...
    - Developers and users knew exactly what software was running on each machine. 
    - （物理）サーバにギリシャ神話の登場人物の名前をつけたりしていた。
    - サーバをペットのように扱った。
    - When a server died it was a major crisis. 
- Obviously, that approach doesn't scale. When you have tens or hundreds of servers, you must start treating them like cattle. 
    - Kubernetes takes the cattle approach to the extreme and takes full responsibility for allocating containers to specific machines.
