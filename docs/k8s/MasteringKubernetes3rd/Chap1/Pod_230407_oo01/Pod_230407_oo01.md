## Pods

> A pod is the unit of work in Kubernetes. Each pod contains one or more containers. 

- All the containers in a pod have the same IP address and port space.
- In addition, all the containers in a pod can have access to shared local storage on the node hosting the pod. 
    - Containers don't get access to local storage or any other storage by default. Volumes of storage must be mounted into each container inside the pod explicitly. 


## Docker container

It is possible to **run multiple applications inside a single Docker container** by having something like supervisord as the main Docker process that runs multiple processes, but this practice is often frowned upon for the following reasons:

- transparency
    - Infrastructure 側から見て、(単一機能単一コンテナにすれば)どういう機能の container であるかわかり安くなる => 管理しやすくなる。
- decoupling software dependencies
- ease of use
- efficiency
